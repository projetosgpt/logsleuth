Here's a `main.rs` file for the LogSleuth project, designed to meet the specifications provided. This example demonstrates basic implementations of log parsing, filtering, and reporting functionalities in Rust. The code is structured to be extensible and maintainable, following Rust's best practices including error handling and memory safety.

```rust
//! LogSleuth - A digital forensic tool for analyzing and reporting system log files.
//!
//! LogSleuth helps security professionals quickly identify suspicious activities by parsing,
//! filtering, and correlating log entries across different sources.

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufReader};
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    // Example log file path
    let path = "example_logs.log";

    // Processing logs
    match process_logs(path) {
        Ok(reports) => {
            for report in reports {
                println!("{}", report);
            }
        },
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("Error processing logs: {}", e);
        }
    }
}

/// Processes log files and generates reports based on suspicious activities.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `path` - A string slice that holds the path to the log file.
///
/// # Returns
/// A Result wrapping a vector of String each containing a report or an error message.
fn process_logs<P: AsRef<Path>>(path: P) -> Result<Vec<String>, io::Error> {
    let file = File::open(path)?;
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);

    let mut reports = Vec::new();

    for line in reader.lines() {
        let line = line?;
        if should_filter(&line) {
            reports.push(format!("Suspicious activity detected: {}", line));
        }
    }

    Ok(reports)
}

/// Determines whether a log entry should be filtered based on predefined criteria.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `entry` - A reference to a string slice representing a log entry.
///
/// # Returns
/// `true` if the log entry meets the suspicious criteria, otherwise `false`.
fn should_filter(entry: &str) -> bool {
    // Example criteria: Filter entries containing "error"
    entry.contains("error")
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_filtering() {
        let log_entry1 = "2023-01-01 12:00:00 INFO User logged in successfully";
        let log_entry2 = "2023-01-01 13:00:00 ERROR Failed to authenticate user";

        assert!(!should_filter(log_entry1));
        assert!(should_filter(log_entry2));
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Documentation & Comments**: The file starts with module-level documentation explaining the purpose of the LogSleuth tool. Functions are also documented using doc comments, explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.
   
2. **Core Functionality**:
   - **Parsing log files**: The `process_logs` function reads from a log file and processes each line.
   - **Filtering based on criteria**: The `should_filter` function is a simple filter that flags log entries containing the word "error". This is just a placeholder and can be expanded based on more complex criteria.
   - **Generating reports**: Each suspicious log entry detected by `should_filter` is formatted into a report string and collected.

3. **Error Handling**: Error handling is done using Rust's `Result` type. Errors in file opening or line reading are propagated up to the main function where they are handled appropriately.

4. **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system is used here to ensure memory safety. For instance, `BufReader` takes ownership of the `File` object, ensuring proper resource management.

5. **Testing**: A simple unit test checks the functionality of the `should_filter` function.

This code can be expanded with more sophisticated parsing and filtering, and potentially multi-threading or asynchronous processing for handling large log files. The placeholder filtering function can also be replaced with a more complex logic or an external configuration of rules.
